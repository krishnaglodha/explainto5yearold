# How can I get in development?
## I'm not from computer background? 

This was me asking few of my friends who were doing good as a developer, when I started my journey. You'll find tons of programming tutorials, videos, bootcamps, etc. about how to get started practically. These all will help you perform your job better or make you familiar with the latest programming trends, jargons, and use cases. 

## But

If you look at the pace in which programming is evolving, it's a *god speed*. It's almost impossible for anyone doesn't matter if he/she is newbie or has 15 years experience, no one can say they are master of even a single programming language. New packages, frameworks, etc. are popping up everyday making you question the choices you made for a project few months back questionable. If you are one of those, don't worry, every one is in same â›µ .

## Why this

Even after knowing that internet is flooded with videos, blogs, live trainings ranging from couple of minutes of overview to literally months and months of tutorials, I still feel that there is a need to make this easier for a specific user base 

<i>People who are trying to get in programming from other backgrounds</i>

As someone who studied Civil Engineering as Bachelor's , Web development is definitely something I wanted to pursue with the combination of <i> Geography </i>

## How do I get started

The whole idea of this project is to allow users to understand the core logic behind various concepts. So when you are starting to learn something new , this will be a good place to checkout the core concept before starting to code in specifc programming language just because it is trending ðŸ“ˆ 


## I want to help

I'm always looking for like minded people to jump in and help in the project. If you think you can contribute to videos, blogs, topic, etc. Please write me at me@krishnaglodha.com
