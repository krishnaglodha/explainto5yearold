# How can I create career in web development?

World is evolving at god speed üí® , almost everyday we are waking up and reading about new AI models, ML Algorithms, Web frameworks, databases, etc. Because of these the application of Computers as hardwares üõ†Ô∏è and softwares üíª  are now cross domains. Almost all industries are now using computers ranging from finance to farming. Thus it is obvious that the workforce is always in demand.


## But

We also here massive layoff news from the companies who are making revenues in $Billions every year. This again makes people think whether this is just another dot com bubble. If you look at software engineers, the good ones, people who understand the logic behind what is happening and why, they are always in demand. Because learning a programming language or framework can be just a couple of weeks of work. But understanding how computers work internally and understand it to create cleaner, fast code will make you sustain the bad days as well.

## Why this

Even after knowing that internet is flooded with videos, blogs, live trainings ranging from couple of minutes of overview to literally months and months of tutorials, I still feel that there is a need to make this easier for a specific user base 

<i>People who are trying to get in programming from other backgrounds</i>

As someone who studied Civil Engineering as Bachelor's , Web development is definitely something I wanted to pursue with the combination of <i> Geography </i>

## How do I get started

The whole idea of this project is to allow users to understand the core logic behind various concepts. So when you are starting to learn something new , this will be a good place to checkout the core concept before starting to code in specifc programming language just because it is trending üìà 


## I want to help

I'm always looking for like minded people to jump in and help in the project. If you think you can contribute to videos, blogs, topic, etc. Please write me at me@krishnaglodha.com  or connect on [twitter](https://twitter.com/krishnaglodha)
